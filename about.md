# Adam Öztürk

# Noah Loomans
Hi, my name is Noah, and I like to code stuff. I usually participate to the Robocup Junior tournament, so this is quite new for me. But i'm really exiced. I really don't know what to expect, but I know it will be just awesome. Let's do this!

# Shasha Mylanus
My name is Sasha. I'm going to tell a little bit about my history with machines. Infact, i was already interrested in machines from TV's to bulldozers on the age of 1. Now, my interrests are more specific, robots and programming. And for this challenge I will ofcourse focus my interrests specificly on Pepper.

# Jochem Baas

# Midas Scheffers
Hi I'm Midas and i like coding things like robots. I'm very interested in them. I'm very exited to program pepper in Japan. This year I won the 1e place in the robocup jr. in the Netherlands. But thats  nothing with that I'm going to Japan.

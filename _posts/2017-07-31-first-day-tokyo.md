<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday we slept until 14:00 in the afternoon. </p>

First, we wanted to eat something. So we walked to the seven eleven. That's a small supermarket. When we had all found something to eat, we paid it and walked back home. Quickly ate our food.
We went a long way from home. Eventually, we came to the center of our neighborhood in Tokyo. There we encountered strange things like plastic food in the showcase. We also went to a few stores. Three of us then bought something. Then we were completely lost, but we had a card so we could go home but we did not forest because we were going to eat somewhere in the city.
We traveled a lot to find a good restaurant. But was a good restaurant. we went home and gamed a bit. and then went to sleep.

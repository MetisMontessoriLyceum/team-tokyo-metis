It was a lot of fun, Midas and I were making buttons with this fancy button machine. And believe it or not, it was a lot of fun! We actually had to take turns using the button machine, not because it was hard, but because we both wanted to operate it! We will hand these buttons out to the participants at the tournament that wants one.

That wasn't the only thing we made today, we also made thank you cards! They look pretty nice. It had a thank you text and our logo on one side, and a group photo on the other side.

But all of that was the easy part because we had a hard time printing them in the first place! But when they were finally printed, it was a really fun project.

Tokyo, here we come!

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday we had two peppers to work with at the university. We used one pepper for the conversation because it wasn’t finished yet and the other one was used to test and improve the open challenge and the dice skill challenge. After some work, lunch and drink breaks we had to go to the stage to show our work to the public and to the jury.</p>

We couldn’t connect to the pepper because Noah’s program wouldn’t stop running. We borrowed the pepper of the Australian team but while we did that our own pepper had already restarted so we used our own Pepper. We discovered that the tabled on our Pepper didn’t work and wouldn’t show any images, but we no more time to change the Pepper so we just went with it. The pepper didn’t say some of the numbers on the dice, which we suspect was because of the different lighting. But the rest of the presentation went very well. When we were done we took place on the tribune and supported everyone. We cheered a little more for the Australians and the kids from Thailand, who we befriended, and the Japanese girls who gave us chopsticks as welcome gift. After all the presentations, we headed home with the Metro.
When we were at Tamagawagakuen-mae Station we went to a grocery store but we didn’t buy anything. Suddenly the Tokyo summer festival started. We had never heard about it but it was great. There was a parade with drums and singing people and a guy in a monkey suit. We bought grilled noodles, a home-made bitter grape food juice, grilled vegetables and meat on a stick, and a grilled corn. It was delicious and awesome. After the festival we went home, watched a movie and went to sleep.

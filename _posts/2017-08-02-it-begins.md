title: Our first workshop with pepper
---
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a great evening with Mario Card, we went to bed and set our alarms to 08:00. Tomorrow will be the day it all begins...</p>


We got out of our bed, packed everything we needed, and went outside. 15 minutes later, we stepped into the metro. This was a moment that redefined a definition that has long stayed untouched: Rush Hour.

And then, when we finally arrived there, we could - after an introduction - play with the Pepper. And it was awesome!

We just started with a simple example of how to make the pepper say something. However, I quickly came to the conclusion that the drag and drop programming language was not fit for our needs, so I went on searching for an alternative. I quickly realized that there was a python block that allowed us to fully program in whatever we wanted, I also discovered at all default blocks were secretly just Python block that you could modify. With this in mind, I started searching for information online and looked at examples in the default blocks until I understood how Python was implemented.

I hope we can use this knowledge tomorrow to make an awesome program!

title: It Begins...

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a great evening with Mario Card, we went to bed and set our alarms to 08:00. Tomorrow will be the day it all begins...</p>


We got out of our bed, packed everything we needed, and went outside. 15 minutes later, we stepped into the metro. This was a moment that redefined a definition that has long stayed untouched: Rush Hour.

And then, when we finally arrived there, we could - after an introduction - play with the Pepper. And it was awesome!

We just started with a simple example of how to make the pepper say something. However, I quickly came to the conclusion that the drag and drop programming language was not fit for our needs, so I went on searching for an alternative. I quickly realized that there was a python block that allowed us to fully program in whatever we wanted, I also discovered at all default blocks were secretly just Python block that you could modify. With this in mind, I started searching for information online and looked at examples in the default blocks until I understood how Python was implemented.

I hope we can use this knowledge tomorrow to make an awesome program!

But that wasn't the end of it, after the practice, we went to have dinner. And I don't mean we bought some dinner, we had dinner provided by the WRS! But before we got there, we first had to take the elevator. The elevator was so full that any reasonable Dutchman wouldn't have stepped in. But... not in Tokyo. We were just expected to enter the elevator like nothing had happened. When we were there, they also had a speech where they said that WRS also stood for friendship, that was really important. Then they gave us a "challenge" to make 10 new friends by the end of the dinner. We already made friends with the Australians and I sat at a table of 6 people I didn't know. So I guess that means it was a success. And the food was _really_ good! We actually had a buffet, and everything was so tasty my plate was already full when I walked 1/4th of the buffet.

Tomorrow, here I come!

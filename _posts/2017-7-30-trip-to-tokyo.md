title: Trip to Tokyo
---

On Saturday evening half past seven we meet at
Schiphol. There we said goodbye at our parents
and joined the queue for baggage check-in. After
that we went through the customs and waited for
boarding. We flew with a double decker plane
from emirates. We had takeoff at ten o’clock.
There was a tablet in the front of every seat upon
which you can play, games, watch movies, listen
to music and watch cameras outside of the plane.
We watched the Lego batman movie and after
that there was a meal. It was not very nice but it
was okay. After that we slept a couple of hours.

We land in Dubai at seven o’clock local time. We left
Dubai around eight o’clock in another emirates plane
but this one had only one deck and a tinier, less good
tablet, but it was still very nice! In the plane we had
breakfast first, there where eggs or fish with a
croissant and some bread. Then we played Tetris,
played on Adem’s Nintendo switch and watched
movies for like 5 hours. There was a dinner with
chicken or fish, it was, like the other meals, not super
but okay.

We landed in Tokyo at eleven o’clock (July 30) then we
stepped on the monorail stepped over on the metro.
When we went out it was half past one and the night
service stopped so we went further with a taxi (That
was quite expensive but we were tired). When we were
at the house. There was a really nice Japanese who
showed us the house and explained how the airco, the
wifi and that kind of things work.
Then we went to sleep because we were tired of the long day.

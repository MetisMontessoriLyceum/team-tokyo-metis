<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday was our second day on the WRS (World Robot Summit). This was actually the first day where we had time to start programming pepper for the contest. Noah started with the open challenge where you must program pepper for a task that can be used in our robotics club. Midas started with the challenge big dice were pepper must say with number is on the dice. Me and Sasha started with the challenge where we must program a conversation between pepper and a human.</p>

We all started with our challenge and worked the whole day on it, around twelve oâ€™clock Noah made pepper get information from the internet. Midas was scanning numbers on the dice for pepper to recognise them. Me and Sasha were programming questions that pepper had to answer.

At the end of the day Noah fixed to let pepper search definitions of words on internet. Midas succeeded to let pepper say the numbers on the dice and me and Sasha had a little conversation with pepper programmed.

When we walked from the metrostation to home we searched for something to eat. Adem saw a restaurant of which Noah said it was nice to eat there. It was actually the best thing of the whole week, there was an tablet by each seat where you could order sushi and when you ordered something it was brought to you by a train!! We had much fun ordering and we went home satisfied.
